# ExtendClickOnceCertificate C# 

## This repo is forked from https://github.com/OceanAirdrop/ExtendClickOnceCertificate. I only added the compiled RenewCert binary release

This project allows you to "renew" your existing ClickOnce certificate and give it a longer expiry date.  It extends Click Once Certs By **105 years!!!**

This code was originally provided by Microsoft and then modified by Cliff Stanford who updated it to add 5 years to the expiry date.

Then Nathan Jones Ported the C++ code to C#.

I have created this project on Github and also extended the expiry date by 105 years. 

Fully tested and confirmed it works.
